To set up:
1. Upload the content of this directory to web server. You can install xampp on windows, put the content inside
the htdocs folder. 
2. Get the database variables. You need to create a database (no need of setting up any tables, just empty DB).
If you have installed and setup xampp, you can create database by going to localhost/phpmyadmin from browser,
3. Set those values in config.php (also in the root of this dir). First four variables needs to be set.
$sql_db should be equal to the name of database you created.
